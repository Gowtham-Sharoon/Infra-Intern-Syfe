Why monitoring?

If there are multiple teams invloss in a k8s cluster, if nything went wrong, it needs to be monitored & looked into it.. 
prometheus is a complete opensource, 

grafana is for visualization, grafana have more data source to connect, one among them was prometheus. The node exporter helps to share the data from 

Prometheus server have API server, 

Kubernetes inbuild api server expose various metrics about the cluster, Those metrices will be fetched by prometheus and it stored in a TSDB (Time Series Database).

The fetched metrices will stored in the SSD/HDD storage. Then the stored metrices will be pushed to slake, email, etc based on the requirments

These metrices are sent from prometheus to alertmanager via push alerts and notify us on slake, gmeet, and multiple platformes. PromQL can also get from the prometheus URL,
